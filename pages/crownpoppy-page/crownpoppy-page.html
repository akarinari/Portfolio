        <h3> Background </h3>
        <p> This was a service project I worked on with a few classmates form my Web Development II honors class in 2022.
             Our client Crown Poppy Service Unit, is an organization that manages the different troops of Girls Scouts in the Pasadena District. 
             The organization requested a team of students from Web Development class at Pasadena High School to create a website that allows them
             to easily communicate and organize the various troops. The team consisted of four members; a project manager, researcher, designer,
             and a developer. The current website the organization had did not fit their needs. Thus the team implemented new features, calendars, 
             resources page, contact and meeting information. These changes were made after careful planning and consideration of the users. 
             We developed mock personas to simulate the different experiences of users.
